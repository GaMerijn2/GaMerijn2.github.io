    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        In the project <a href="#">Operation Starfall</a> we made a new enemy called Scopi.
        <br>
        We had to convert the scopi prefab into a <a href="#">BaseEnemy</a> variant to be able to use it in game and make it interact with the environment.

        <p>This is <a href="#">Scopi</a>.<br> He's one of the enemies in the game <a href="#">Operation Starfall</a> and its the enemy a classmate and I have been working on.<br><br> We had to remake the enemy's attack states from code to the <a href="#">StateMachine</a> and convert him from just code to a whole enemy as a enemy prefab in the game that could be used in the game's systems.<br>at first you couldn't hit and damage him, so he was invincible. <br><br> We had to fix some bugs on the way and it took like 2/3 weeks to complete him.<br><br> You are able to hit Scopi and get him stuck in a magnetic platform to you can use him to destroy walls you normally cannot destroy and he is basicly a death ray that <a href="#">demolishes</a> everything in his path.</p>

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <div class="feature-content">
        <p><a href="#">Scopi</a> doesn't move in the game by itself, because he is a stationairy enemy<br><br>When he finds a target to attack he <a href="#">rotates</a> towards the target and starts to charge his laser. If the laser is fully charged he lets out a strong beam that can destroy everything in his path and you will get hit if you touch the laser's beam.<br><br>You can make him stop shooting by hitting him once so he gets in the <a href="#">fuzzy state</a> and stops shooting so you can kill him if you're fast enough.</p>

        <p>Here you can see a <a href="#">Scopi</a> in the game, just hanging in the air waiting for a player to step into his sights.<br><br> You may have noticed the 2 enemies at the end of the gif bouncing on the ground, thats the result of Scopi's laser <a href="#">hitting</a> the 2 enemies so they get hit and go into a fuzzy state themselves.</p>

    <h2>Behaviour</h2>
    <div class="feature-content">
        <p>On the right you can see the <a href="#">StateMachine</a> of a Scopi. In this graph you can see nodes that have scripts attached to them that <a href="#">handle the behaviour</a> of the enemy the StateMachine is for.<br><br>The nodes have a Input (<a href="#">OnEnter</a>) and a output (<a href="#">OnExit</a>). These can be used to trigger different types of behaviour that the attached script has.<br><br>This way you can fully customize the behaviour of a enemy, and it's easy to change if needed.</p>

        <p>I contributed to the conversion of Scopi's <a href="#">states</a> and <a href="#">attack scripts</a> while my teammate transfered the looks and visual effects of Scopi.</p>
